# Deep Dream
This repository includes a tensorflow implementation of DeepDream. DeepDream is an experiment that visualizes the patterns learned by a neural network. Similar to when a child watches clouds and tries to interpret random shapes, DeepDream over-interprets and enhances the patterns it sees in an image. This code is a minimal implementation of DeepDream as described by Alexander Mordvintsev in his blog post.

# Hyper Parameters
* Pre-trained model : InceptionV3
* Learning rate: 0.01

# Additional Information
Choosing different layers create different patterns. Also, different type of loss functions and combinations of various loss function can be used to create different patterns.
